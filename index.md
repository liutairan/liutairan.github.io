### Biography

Tairan Liu received his B.Sc. degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>, Hefei, Anhui, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA, in 2020. He held postdoctoral appointments at the University of Georgia (2020-2021) and North Carolina State University (2021-2022) until starting as an assistant professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at CSULB in August 2022. His research mainly focuses on control theory, multi-agent systems, and robotics.

<!-- I received my BS degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>, and Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>. -->

<!-- <br /> -->
<!-- During my Ph.D. period, I worked at <a href="https://icorelab.github.io" target="_blank">iCORE Lab</a> in the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/mie/" target="_blank">Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>. My dissertation is entitled “Distance-Based Formation Control: Theory, Applications, and Issues” under the guidance of Dr. Marcio de Queiroz. I worked on multi-agent/robot system formation control problems and aerial robotic networks. I proposed new control algorithms with mathematical proofs, built a quadrotor fleet from scratch, developed micro-controller- and computer-based software, and conducted experiments to validate theories. -->

<!-- After my Ph.D. graduation, I worked at the <a href="https://www.uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a> (UGA) as a postdoctoral fellow from September 2020 to October 2021. My research at UGA primarily focuses on multi-robot coverage control and path planning, deployment of robots for non-destructive agricultural sensing and measurements, intra-swarm or human-swarm interactions, and multi-agent system autonomy. -->
