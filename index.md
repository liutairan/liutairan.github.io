I received my BS degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>, and PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>.

<br />
During my PhD period, I worked at <a href="https://icorelab.github.io" target="_blank">iCORE Lab</a> in the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/mie/" target="_blank">Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>. My dissertation is entitled “Distance-Based Formation Control: Theory, Applications, and Issues” under the guidance of Dr. Marcio de Queiroz. I worked on multi-agent/robot system formation control problem and aerial robotic networks. I proposed new control algorithms with mathematical proofs, built a quadrotor fleet from scratch, developed micro-controller- and computer-based software, and conducted experiments to validate theories.

<br />
After my PhD graduation, I worked at the <a href="https://www.uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a> (UGA) as a postdoctoral fellow from September 2020 to October 2021. My research at UGA primarily focuses on multi-robot coverage control and path planning, deployment of robots for non-destructive agricultural sensing and measurements, intra-swarm or human-swarm interactions, and multi-agent system autonomy.

<br />
Currently, I am appointed as a postdoctoral research scholar working at the <a href="https://haosu-robotics.github.io/" target="_blank">Biomechatronics and Intelligent Robotics Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University</a>. My current research primarily focuses on wearable robotics, soft robotics, and surgical robotics.

<br />
I am open to tenure-track assistant professor positions.
