I received my BS degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>, and PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>.

<!-- I work at <a href="https://icorelab.github.io" target="_blank">iCORE Lab</a>, which is a research group of the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/mie/" target="_blank">Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>. -->

<br />
During my PhD period, I worked at <a href="https://icorelab.github.io" target="_blank">iCORE Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/mie/" target="_blank">Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>. Since 2016, I have been working on multi-agent system formation control theory and aerial robotic network for agricultural applications. In these research projects, I have proposed new control algorithms with mathematical proofs, built a quadrotor fleet from scratch, developed micro-controller- and computer-based software, and conducted experiments to validate theories. My dissertation is entitled “Distance-Based Formation Control: Theory, Applications, and Issues” under the guidance of Prof. Marcio de Queiroz.

<br />
Currently, I work at <a href="http://cscl.engr.uga.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Velni's Lab</a>, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Georgia.

<br />

I am open to new opportunities, such as postdoctoral researcher, research scientist, research assistant professor, assistant professor, or R&D engineer.

<br />
My research interests include <em>System and Control Theory</em>, <em>Multi-Agent/Robot Systems</em>, <em>Cyber-Physical Systems</em>, <em>Complex Networks</em> <em>Large-Scale Networked Systems</em>, <em>Cooperative Control</em>, <em>Distributed Systems/Algorithm</em>, <em>Human-Robot/Swarm Interaction</em>, <em>Robotics (Aerial/Ground/Underwater/Manipulator)</em>, and the applications or intersections of the above areas, such as <em>Communication Networks, Social Networks, Precision Agriculture, Farm Management, Smart Farming, Traffic Control, Smart City, Connected Vehicles, Multi-Robot Smart Manufacturing/Construction, Multi-Robot Task Allocation</em>.
