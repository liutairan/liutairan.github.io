I received my BS degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>, and PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>.


<br />
During my PhD period, I worked at <a href="https://icorelab.github.io" target="_blank">iCORE Lab</a> in the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/mie/" target="_blank">Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>. My dissertation is entitled “Distance-Based Formation Control: Theory, Applications, and Issues” under the guidance of Dr. Marcio de Queiroz. I worked on multi-agent/robot system formation control problem and aerial robotic networks. I proposed new control algorithms with mathematical proofs, built a quadrotor fleet from scratch, developed micro-controller- and computer-based software, and conducted experiments to validate theories.

<br />
Currently, I am appointed as a postdoctoral fellow working at <a href="http://cscl.engr.uga.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Javad Mohammadpour Velni’s lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a>. My current research primarily focuses on multi-robot coverage control and path planning, deployment of robots for sensing and measurements, intra-swarm or human-swarm interactions, and multi-agent system autonomy.

<br />
I am open to new opportunities, such as tenure-track assistant professor or postdoctoral researcher.

<br />
My research interests include:
* System and Control Theory
* Multi-Agent/Robot System
* Cyber-Physical System
* Complex Network
* Large-Scale Networked System
* Cooperative Control
* Distributed System/Algorithm
* Human-Robot / Swarm Interaction
* Robotics (Aerial / Ground / Underwater / Manipulator / Surgical / Humanoid)

*Applications or intersections of the above areas: communication networks, social networks, smart farming, precision agriculture, farm management, livestock management, aquaculture management, intelligent transportation, ground / low-altitude traffic control, smart city, connected vehicles, multi-robot smart manufacturing / construction, multi-robot task allocation.*
