### Project goal

A human operator can give feedback and corrections to a robot if it is not working as desired. However, monitoring and controlling a large swarm of robots is complex on a human scale. So, the significance of my present research is utilizing
human operatorsâ€™ valuable experience teaching computers to make decisions automatically and achieve autonomy to some extent.
The goal of this work is to achieve multi-agent system autonomy such that monitoring and managing a swarm of robots is possible with a few or even no operators behind the control panel.

### My role

Researcher, Supervisor

### My contribution

* Proposed the structure of the human-swarm interaction model
* Instructed a student to create graphical user interfaces (GUI) to collect data, train models from the collected data, analyze results, and prepare manuscript
* Proposed various extensions of this approach to multiple topics, e.g., task (re)assignment, resource (re)allocation, supply chain, human-robot collaboration


The details of this project will be unveiled later.
