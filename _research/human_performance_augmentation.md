### Project goal

This project aims to create wearable robotic systems (e.g., exoskeleton or prosthesis) to aid people's daily activity. For people with medical conditions that affect their locomotion, these wearable robots are expected to assist them in having a more accessible everyday life. For people without medical conditions, these wearable robots can augment their performance or protect them from the injuries caused by labor-intensive tasks.
