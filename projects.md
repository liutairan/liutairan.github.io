Designed and built a UUV to mimic the propulsion pattern of black ghost knifefish.
Developed program on Arduino for the UUV.
Studied the effects of the frequency and amplitude of the swaying fin ray, wave number in the fin surface, and the speed of the incoming flow on propulsion thrust.

* [**Bionic Double-Tail Fin UUV**](https://liutairan.github.io/projects/double_tail_fin)<br>
September 2011 – May 2012<br>
Conducted experiments to optimize the performance of the double tail fin UUV.
Developed a whole system to automatically conduct experiment, collect and process data, and plot results.

October 2011 – November 2011<br>
Designed and built an adjustable dual circular cylinder model for the fluid experiment.
Conducted experiments with hydrogen bubbles, laser beam, and high resolution high speed camera to study the water flow trajectory after passing dual circular cylinder.

* [**Composite Bionic Actuators**](https://liutairan.github.io/projects/composite_actuator)<br>
April 2011 – August 2011<br>
Assisted with motion pattern design.
Developed programs on Arduino for the actuators.
