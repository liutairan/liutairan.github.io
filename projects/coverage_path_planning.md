### Project goal

The goal of this project was to propose new approaches and algorithms that can be used to deploy robots in the fields. The robots may not have uniform configurations, such as dynamics, parameters, and capabilities. The environments may also have irregular shapes to capture the features of real fields.

### My role

Researcher

### My contribution

* Proposed new concepts and algorithms of coverage control and path planning for heterogeneous robots
* Provided mathematical proofs and conducted numerical simulations to validate algorithms

### Scientific Progress

So far, we have developed various coverage control and path planning algorithms to allow for coordination and cooperation among vehicles deployed in the field for data collection purposes. Particularly, two scenarios were examined as follows: (i) deploying a heterogeneous group of drones (in terms of weight, velocity, battery charge, and being equipped with sensors of different footprints) to monitor fields; and (ii) coping with the case that fields to be covered have irregular (e.g., non-convex) shapes. The tools developed so far in the project have been validated using extensive simulation models and resulted in two publications.

### Demonstration

The simulation results of the environments with irregular shapes are shown below. The details of the heterogeneous agents case will be unveiled later.
