### Project goal

The goal of this project was to propose new approaches and algorithms that can be used to deploy robots which don't have uniform configurations, such as dynamics, parameters, and capabilities.

### My role

Researcher

### My contribution

* Proposed new concepts and algorithms of coverage control and path planning for heterogeneous robots
* Provided mathematical proofs and conducted numerical simulations to validate algorithms

### Scientific Progress

So far, we have developed various coverage control and path planning algorithms to allow for coordination and cooperation among vehicles deployed in the field for data collection purposes. Particularly, two scenarios were examined as follows: (i) deploying a heterogeneous group of drones (in terms of weight, velocity, battery charge, and being equipped with sensors of different footprints) to monitor fields; and (ii) coping with the case that fields to be covered have irregular (e.g., non-convex) shapes. The tools developed so far in the project have been validated using extensive simulation models and resulted in two publications. Field testing of the algorithms are yet to be done.
