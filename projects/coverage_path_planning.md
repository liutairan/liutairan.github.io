### Background


### Scientific Progress

Developing various path planning and coverage control algorithms to allow for coordination and cooperation among vehicles deployed in the field for data collection purposes. Particularly, several scenarios were examined as follows: (i) deploying a heterogeneous group of drones (in terms of weight, velocity, battery charge, and being equipped with sensors of different footprints) to monitor fields; and (ii) coping with the case that fields to be covered have irregular (e.g., non-convex) shapes. The tools developed so far in the project have been validated using extensive simulation models and resulted in two publications. Field testing of the algorithms are yet to be done.
