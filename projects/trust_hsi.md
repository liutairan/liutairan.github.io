### Project goal

A human operator can give feedback and corrections to a robot if it is not working as desired. Monitoring and controlling a swarm of robots is not something easy to do for one operator. The goal of this work is to achieve multi-agent system autonomy such that monitoring and managing a swarm of robots is possible with a few operators or even no one behind the control panel.

### My role

Researcher, Supervisor

### My contribution

* Proposed the structure of the human-swarm interaction model
* Instructed a student to create graphical user interfaces (GUI) to collect users' data, train models from the collected data, analyze results, and prepare manuscript
* Proposed various extensions of this approach to multiple subjects


The details will be unveiled later.
