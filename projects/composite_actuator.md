### Project goal
The goal of this project was to explore new approaches of propulsion for underwater vehicles.

###	My role
Undergraduate Researcher

### My contribution

* Designed motion pattern for the bionic actuators which mimic the movement of pectoral fins
* Developed code on Arduino for the actuators to follow the designed motion trajectory
* Designed parts with AutoCAD, fabricated with engraving machine, and assembled the mechanical structure
* Conducted experimental validations

### Demonstration
