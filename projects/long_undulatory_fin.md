Undergraduate graduation project and bachelor's degree thesis.

### Project goal
The goal of this project was to (1) design and build a bionic UUV that mimics the approach of propulsion of black ghost knifefish, and (2) study the factors which have effects on the performance of the UUV.
### My role
Undergraduate Researcher
### My contribution
* Designed and built a UUV to mimic the propulsion pattern of black ghost knifefish
* Developed code on Arduino to control motors and manage wireless communication between the UUV and computer
* Studied the effects of the frequency and amplitude of the swaying fin ray, wave number in the fin surface, and the speed of the incoming flow on thrust
