### Introduction   

eMolFrag is an open source software to decompose organic compounds into non-redundant sets of fragments retaining the connecticity information.

The code has been developed in Python. In order to perform the fragmentation process, eMolFrag utilizes BRICS algorithm implemented in the RDKit Python module.

Although the resulting fragments can be paired with a variety of virtual molecular synthesis tools, eMolFrag is specifically optimized to work with the software eSynth.
